# Arduino Motor Control

This repository contains three Arduino sketches and one Excel file, designed to work with a differential drive mobile robot. The robots have an ESP32 Feather microcontroller, 2 MG90S Micro Servos (continuous), and a battery.

These files will set up the robot to be used with the EaterMover-AprilTag repository. When starting from scratch, these files should be used in the order they are listed below.

## ðŸ“‚ Files

1. `get_MAC_address.ino`:
   - **Description:** Reads the MAC address of the ESP32 Feather and prints it to the serial monitor.
   - **Usage:** Copy MAC address to main.py in the EaterMover-AprilTag respository
2. `servo_characterization.ino`
   - **Description:** Sweeps from 0-100% PWM in 25% intervals to produce PWM-velocity mapping.
   - **Usage:**  Measure corresponding servo angular velocities and copy into servo_normalization.xlsx
3. `servo_normalization.xlsx`
   - **Description:** Given non-linear PWM-velocity mapping, linearizes velocity curve and produces corresponding PWM values.
   - **Usage:** After updating angular velocity values, copy output into motor_controller.ino
4. `motor_controller.ino`
   - **Description:** Processes velocity commands recieved via BLE, converting them into PWM signals for the servos.
   - **Configuration:**
     - WHEELBASE: distance between wheels in millimeters
     - WHEEL_RADIUS: radius of wheels in millimeters
     - WHEEL_VEL_MAX: max velocity of wheels in millimeters/second (choose lower max)
     - SCALE_L[5], SCALE_R[5]: PWM-velocity mapping from servo_normalization.xlsx
     - SERVICE_UUID: service UUID for the ESP32, can be found with nRF Connect app
     - CHARACTERISTIC_UUID: characteristic UUID for the ESP32, can be found with nRF Connect app
   - **Usage:**
     - Receives linear and angular velocity values via BLE
     - Controls servos given adjusted PWM-velocity mapping to achieve given linear and angular velocity
